# Solving Lambert's Problem Programatically in Haskell.
### By Joel Urwin


### 1: Research
The first step for solving this problem was to research the problem itself.
A lot of my research stemmed from [this document from NASA.](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19690027552/downloads/19690027552.pdf)
From this document, there are a few variables that are defined.

| _Variables_                          |
|--------------------------------------|
| G = universal gravitational constant |
| M = mass of attracting body          |
| P = _GM_                             |
| a = semimajor axis of transfer orbit |
| e = eccentricity of transfer orbit   |
